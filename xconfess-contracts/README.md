## What the contract does

`ConfessionAnchor` stores a 32-byte hash of each confession alongside the
client-supplied timestamp and the Stellar ledger sequence number at the time
of anchoring. It enforces uniqueness: the same hash can only be anchored
once. Off-chain content is never stored on-chain — only the hash.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Install |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Rust (stable) | 1.81 | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target | — | `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| `stellar` CLI (Stellar CLI) | 22.0.0 | See [Stellar CLI docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup) |
| Node.js | 18.0.0 | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| npm | 9.0.0 | Bundled with Node 18+ |

> **Note:** The `stellar` CLI was previously called `soroban`. All commands
> below use the current `stellar contract ...` form. If you have an older
> install run `stellar --version` and upgrade if it reports < 22.0.0.

---

## Toolchain setup

Run this once on a fresh machine. All commands are idempotent.

```bash
# 1. Install Rust (skip if already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# 2. Add the Soroban WASM compilation target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 3. Install the Stellar CLI
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --version 22.0.0 --features opt

# 4. Verify the toolchain
rustc --version          # expect: rustc 1.81.x or later
stellar --version        # expect: stellar 22.0.0
```

After installing, return to the **monorepo root** and run:

```bash
npm install
```

npm workspaces will resolve `@xconfess/backend` and `@xconfess/contract`
together. The contract workspace has no npm dependencies of its own —
`npm install` is a no-op for it, but the presence of `package.json` lets
npm scripts at the root delegate to it uniformly.

## Building

### Development build (fast, unoptimised)

```bash
# From monorepo root
npm run contract:build

# From xconfess-contract/ directly
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Release build (optimised WASM for deployment)

```bash
# From monorepo root
npm run contract:build:release

# From xconfess-contract/ directly
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The release WASM is written to:

```
xconfess-contract/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/xconfess_contract.wasm
```

### Optimise WASM binary (optional — reduces upload fees)

After a release build, run the Stellar CLI optimiser to strip unused sections:

```bash
npm run optimize --workspace=xconfess-contract
# or:
stellar contract optimize \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/xconfess_contract.wasm
```

The optimised file is written next to the original with an `.optimized.wasm`
suffix.

---

## Testing

### All tests (unit + integration)

```bash
# From monorepo root
npm run contract:test

# From xconfess-contract/ directly
cargo test
```

**Expected output (clean run):**

```
running 23 tests in src/lib.rs
test anchor_and_verify_confession ... ok
test anchor_height_is_recorded_from_ledger_sequence ... ok
...
test result: ok. 23 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
```

### Integration tests only

```bash
# From monorepo root
npm run contract:test:integration

# From xconfess-contract/ directly
cargo test --test confession_moderation
cargo test --test access_control
```

### Tests with output (useful for gas figures)

```bash
npm run test:verbose --workspace=xconfess-contract
# or:
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

### Code coverage (optional — requires cargo-tarpaulin)

```bash
# Install once
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# Run
npm run test:coverage --workspace=xconfess-contract
# Coverage report written to xconfess-contract/coverage/lcov.info
```

---

## Linting and formatting

```bash
# Lint (all warnings treated as errors — mirrors CI)
npm run contract:lint

# Format code in-place
npm run contract:fmt

# Check formatting without modifying files (used in CI)
npm run contract:fmt:check
```

Clippy rules are inherited from the workspace default. No `#[allow(...)]`
attributes are used in contract code; all lints must be resolved.

---

## Deployment

### Prerequisites for deployment

1. Generate or import a Stellar keypair:

```bash
stellar keys generate --global my-deployer-key --network testnet
stellar keys address my-deployer-key
```

2. Fund the account on testnet via Friendbot:

```bash
stellar network fund my-deployer-key --network testnet
```

### Deploy to testnet

```bash
# Build a release WASM first
npm run contract:build:release

# Deploy
STELLAR_SOURCE_ACCOUNT=my-deployer-key npm run contract:deploy:testnet
```

Or directly:

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/xconfess_contract.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source my-deployer-key
```

The command prints the deployed contract ID. Save it in `xconfess-backend/.env`:

```env
CONTRACT_ID=CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
```

### Initialize the contract

After deployment, call `initialize` once to set the owner address:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  --source my-deployer-key \
  -- \
  initialize \
  --owner $(stellar keys address my-deployer-key)
```

### Deploy to mainnet

```bash
STELLAR_SOURCE_ACCOUNT=my-mainnet-key npm run contract:deploy:mainnet
```

> **Warning:** Mainnet deployments are permanent and incur real XLM fees.
> Always test on testnet first.

---

## Contract API

### `initialize(owner: Address)`

Deploys role state. Must be called once immediately after deployment.
Panics if called a second time.

### `anchor_confession(hash: BytesN<32>, timestamp: u64) → Symbol`

| Return value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"anchored"` | Hash stored for the first time |
| `"exists"` | Hash was already anchored; no state changed |

Emits event: `topics = ("confession_anchor", hash)`, `data = (timestamp, anchor_height)`.

### `verify_confession(hash: BytesN<32>) → Option<u64>`

Returns `Some(timestamp)` if the hash is anchored, `None` otherwise.

### `get_confession_count() → u64`

Returns the total number of unique hashes ever anchored.

### `assign_admin(caller: Address, target: Address)`

Grants `target` the admin role. Caller must be the owner.

### `revoke_admin(caller: Address, target: Address)`

Revokes `target`'s admin role. Caller must be the owner.

### `transfer_ownership(caller: Address, new_owner: Address)`

Transfers contract ownership. Caller must be the current owner.
Emits `own_xfer` event.

### `resolve(caller: Address, confession_id: u32)`

Marks a reported confession as resolved. Caller must be admin or owner.

### `is_owner(addr: Address) → bool`
### `is_admin(addr: Address) → bool`
### `can_moderate(addr: Address) → bool`
### `get_owner() → Address`

View functions — no auth required, no events emitted.

## Architecture notes

**No content on-chain.** Only a SHA-256 (or equivalent 32-byte) hash is
stored. The full confession text lives in the Postgres database managed by
`xconfess-backend`. The hash provides a tamper-evident anchor: if the
backend content is altered the hash will no longer match the chain record.

**Instance storage for all data.** All keys (`count`, confession hashes,
owner, admin set) use `env.storage().instance()`. Instance storage is
renewed automatically as long as the contract is active, avoiding manual
TTL extension in the current protocol version.

**`cdylib` + `rlib` dual crate type.** `cdylib` produces the WASM binary
for deployment. `rlib` allows integration tests (which live under `test/`
and are compiled as separate crates by cargo) to `use xconfess_contract::*`
without a separate package.

**Error codes are numeric `u32` constants.** Panic messages in privileged
functions encode the `AccessError` discriminant as a string (e.g. `"2"` for
`NotAuthorized`). This lets the NestJS backend and tests match on stable
codes without parsing message text.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `error[E0463]: can't find crate for 'std'`

The contract uses `#![no_std]`. You are likely compiling for the host
target instead of WASM. Always pass `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown`:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### `stellar: command not found`

Install or update the Stellar CLI:

```bash
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --version 22.0.0 --features opt
```

Ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is on your `PATH`.

### `error: linker 'cc' not found` (Linux)

Install the C linker:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential   # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install gcc                   # Fedora/RHEL
```

### Tests fail with `attempt to subtract with overflow`

Dev and release profiles both have `overflow-checks = true`. This is
intentional — fix the overflow rather than disabling the check.

### `npm run contract:test` exits with `cargo not found`

npm delegates to cargo via shell. Ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in the `PATH`
for the shell session that runs npm scripts. Add to `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```
